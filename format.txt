In this tutorial we are going to look at some of format string functions in C language. 

Ok then lets begin...

						    puts()

The first we have puts() function in our hand. This function is used to print a string stream on the output

however with newline. When you use this function probably your output will be on the newline. If not then, 

it has a trouble look at your code again.  



syntax of puts() in C below:

	puts(string);



example:

	int formatPuts()
	{
		puts("this is a string");
	}


						    fputs()

The second we are looking for fputs() function at this time. In this function 'no newline' differently and

has a one more parameter which is 'stdout'. Out of this nearly same with other puts() function.



syntax of fputs() in C below:

	fputs(string,stdout);



example:


	int formatfPuts()
	{
		fputs("this is a string no newline",stdout);
	}





						    printf()


This is the most common way to print text long on output and we have not newline again by the way we have to use
that form "\n" in the last of string. Also this function print other values of variables and it is complex.



syntax of printf() in C below:
	

	printf(string);




example:


	int printfFun()
	{
		printf("this is a text in printf() function\n");
	}
